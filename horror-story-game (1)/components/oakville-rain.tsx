Official reports claim it was "atmospheric debris," but classified medical records tell a different story. Twenty-three residents fell ill with identical symptoms: severe fatigue, mental confusion, and most disturbing - increased susceptibility to suggestion. Hospital blood tests revealed microscopic organisms that don't match any known Earth biology. The organisms appeared to be engineered to cross the blood-brain barrier and affect neural pathways related to critical thinking and resistance to authority.`,

They're designed to produce specific neurochemicals that reduce anxiety about authority figures while increasing compliance with media messaging. Most disturbing: the organisms can replicate using the host's own cellular machinery, creating permanent behavioral changes. Recent blood tests on Oakville residents show the organisms are still active 30 years later. The affected population demonstrates 73% higher acceptance of government narratives and 89% lower participation in protest activities.`,

Multiple residents report similar changes: decreased interest in conspiracy theories, increased trust in pharmaceutical companies, and a strange compulsion to consume more media. Most unsettling: when shown evidence of government corruption, their brains literally cannot process it. MRI scans show reduced activity in areas associated with critical thinking.`,

The project's goal is to create a population that willingly surrenders freedom for perceived security.
