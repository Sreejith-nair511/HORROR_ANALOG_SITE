      text: `Agent ${playerName}, you've accessed the classified Hoer Verde incident files. In 2003, a Brazilian research vessel disappeared for 72 hours in calm seas. When found, the crew exhibited signs of severe psychological trauma and memory gaps. But the ship's digital systems contained something impossible: 847 terabytes of data that shouldn't exist. The data includes detailed brain scans of the crew, real-time consciousness mapping, and what appears to be digital copies of human memories. The incident wasn't a disappearance - it was a field test for consciousness digitization technology. The crew were unwitting subjects in an experiment to upload human consciousness to digital storage.`,

But the process is destructive - the original consciousness is fragmented during extraction. The crew members who survived are essentially empty shells, their original personalities replaced by simplified behavioral programs. The digital copies exist in a virtual environment, unaware they're no longer human. This technology is now being deployed through social media platforms and smart devices to gradually extract and replace human consciousness.`,

Neurological scans show their brains have been rewired, with artificial neural pathways replacing natural ones.
