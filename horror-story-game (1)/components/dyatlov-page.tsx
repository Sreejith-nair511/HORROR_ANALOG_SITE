      text: `Agent ${playerName}, you've accessed the classified Dyatlov Pass incident files. Nine experienced hikers died under impossible circumstances in 1959. Official cause: "unknown compelling force." But recently declassified radio transmissions reveal something else. At 23:47 on February 1st, the team's radio operator sent a final message: "The lights are coming closer. They're not from this world. Coordinates match other disappearances." The coordinates he transmitted lead to locations across the globe - all sites of unexplained phenomena. Radio interference patterns from that night match signals detected at other "anomaly sites" decades apart. Something was coordinating these events across time and space.`,

Most disturbing: the final transmission contains your voice, ${playerName}, saying "The investigation is complete. Initiate final phase." But this recording is from 1959, decades before you were born. The timestamp shows it was transmitted 3 minutes after the hikers' deaths.`,

The pattern forms a complex geometric shape that, when viewed from above, resembles a neural network. Each "node" represents a test site for different aspects of human consciousness manipulation. Dyatlov Pass was the central coordination point - the brain of the network. The hikers weren't victims; they were unwitting operators of a vast psychological experiment spanning decades.`,
