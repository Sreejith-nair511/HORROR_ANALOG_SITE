      text: `Agent ${playerName}, you've accessed the classified audio files from the Dyatlov Pass incident. Nine experienced hikers died under impossible circumstances in February 1959. The official cause: "unknown compelling force." However, recovered radio equipment contains a final transmission never released to the public. At 23:47 on February 1st, expedition leader Igor Dyatlov transmitted: "The lights... they're not from aircraft. They're moving in patterns. Mathematical patterns. Something is watching us." The transmission cuts to static, then resumes with a voice that isn't Dyatlov's: "The test subjects are responding as predicted. Initiating Phase 2."`,

The patterns follow the Fibonacci sequence, creating a hypnotic effect that overrides conscious thought. Witnesses describe feeling "compelled" to follow the lights, losing control of their actions. Similar lights have been reported at every major unexplained disappearance of the last century. They're not natural phenomena - they're a form of consciousness manipulation technology, testing human responses to external neural influence.`,

More puzzling: the hikers' footprints in the snow show they walked calmly away from the tent in single file, despite sub-zero temperatures and inadequate clothing.
