When found, the crew exhibited signs of severe psychological trauma and memory gaps. But the ship's digital systems contained something impossible: 847 terabytes of data that shouldn't exist. The data includes detailed brain scans of the crew, real-time consciousness mapping, and what appears to be digital copies of human memories. The incident wasn't a disappearance - it was a field test for consciousness digitization technology. The crew were unwitting subjects in an experiment to upload human consciousness to digital storage.`,
